## Overview

**Super Mario with Deep Q-Learning** is an interactive AI project where a neural agent learns to master the classic game of Super Mario through reinforcement learning. Designed entirely as a self-explanatory Jupyter Notebook, this project offers a hands-on experience to understand how deep learning models work in real time. Simply open the notebook and follow the in-cell instructions.
